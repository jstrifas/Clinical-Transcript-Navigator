# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

**Clinical Transcript Navigator** (the UI was formerly branded "Premier Care Specialist Console") — a single-folder web app that helps Care Specialists analyze patient call transcripts against the SOP library and recommend next steps. Designed to *feel* like an internal tool integrated with Salesforce Health Cloud (the patient's EHR), Google Workspace, Five9, and Outlook (all mocked). The user-facing name lives in `public/app.html` (`<title>`, header wordmark, footer); "Premier Health" still appears as the *fictional* health-system context (mock EHR/SSO, the drafted-email signature) and is intentionally distinct from the app name.

Layers on top of plain transcript-analysis:
- **Public / self-serve — no sign-in.** The SSO gate was removed; `public/app.html` boots straight into the analyzer via `initApp()` and shows a hardcoded "Jordan G / Care Specialist" chip. `/api/sso/signin` still exists but nothing calls it.
- **Sample-patient picker** (Step 1 in the UI) loads one of three full call transcripts into the box automatically — no upload required — and auto-runs the mock EHR lookup. Transcripts are embedded client-side in `SAMPLE_PATIENTS` (`app.html`), *separate* from the smoke-test snippets in `import.js` (see "Smoke tests"). The transcript box auto-grows to fit (`autoGrowTranscript()`).
- **Integration import/export stubs** — branded `Import from Google Workspace` / `Import from Five9` buttons (they just open the file picker); per-step CTAs push results to mocked Salesforce / EHR / Outlook endpoints via `/api/integrations/export`.
- **SOP Library is read-only in the UI** — a view-only grid. The `/api/sops` CRUD routes still exist server-side but nothing in the UI invokes them; edit `sops.json` in the repo to change SOP content.

## Run / dev

**Two equivalent backends share the same data files and most of the `/api/*` contract.** Pick whichever your machine has set up:

**Next.js (deployable to Vercel — production target):**
```bash
npm install
npm run dev    # http://localhost:4321
```

**PowerShell 5.1 (Windows local-only fallback, no Node required):**
```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File server.ps1
# http://localhost:4321
```

Both serve `public/app.html` at `/` and read `sops.json` / `crm.json` from the repo root. **PowerShell mode lacks `/api/extract` and `/api/preflight`, and its `/api/evaluate` returns the OLD 2-pill shape** (`recommendation`/`next_steps` scores) rather than the 4-dimension `evaluation` object the frontend expects — so on PS the confidence pills / Evaluation card render as "unavailable" or blank. **Next.js is the full-feature path; prefer `npm run dev`** (or deploy to Vercel). A committed `package-lock.json` pins the dependency tree. Two preview configs exist in `.claude/launch.json`: `premier-analyzer` (PowerShell) and `premier-next` (`npm run dev`).

To enable AI engines: copy `.env.example` to `.env` (or `.env.local` for Next.js), set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `GEMINI_API_KEY`. **For Vercel deployment, set the same vars in the Vercel project's Environment Variables — the Production scope MUST be checked, and a redeploy is required after adding/changing them** (env vars are baked at build/start, not picked up live). Verify via `/api/health` which returns `engine` and `evaluator` flags.

**PowerShell restart pitfall:** `server.ps1` reads `sops.json`/`crm.json`/`.env` from `$PSScriptRoot`. Always launch with an absolute path — `-File C:\...\Call Transcript Analyzer\server.ps1` — or set the working directory explicitly. Starting with a relative path can leave the listener bound to a stale folder's data.

**Vercel deployment caveats:**
- **SOP edits do not persist on Vercel** — the function filesystem is read-only. `lib/data.js#writeSops` throws `READONLY` when `process.env.VERCEL` is set, and the SOP CRUD routes return 503 in production. Local dev still writes to `sops.json` normally.
- The Anthropic key in the source-controlled `.env.txt` (now removed and gitignored via `.env.*`) was a near-miss during the initial repo push. Don't recreate that pattern. `.env.example` is the only `.env*` file allowed in the repo.

## Smoke tests (no test suite)

The 3 case-study patients live in `crm.json` (Sarah Mitchell, Robert Carlson, Maria Alvarez). **Two separate sets of sample transcripts now exist — do not conflate them:**

**1. Canonical regression baseline** — the short snippets in `pages/api/integrations/import.js` (`googleworkspace` = Sarah, `five9` = Bob, default = Maria). The local engine MUST still produce these dispositions after any heuristic / prompt / SOP change:

| Sample | Disposition | Findings (local engine) |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|
| Sarah  | Revision Case | BAR-001, BAR-002, BAR-003 |
| Bob    | Ineligible    | JNT-002, JNT-004 |
| Maria  | Deferred      | JNT-001, JNT-003 |

**2. UI picker transcripts** — the full "Carrum" intake conversations embedded in `SAMPLE_PATIENTS` (`public/app.html`) — what a public user actually loads. They are clinically richer and worded differently, so the **local heuristic under-fires** on them (its per-SOP regex guardrails are tuned to the snippet phrasings above). Observed local-engine output:

| Patient | Disposition (local) | Findings (local) |
|---------|---------------------|------------------|
| Sarah   | Revision Case | BAR-001, GEN-001 (misses BAR-002 EGD, BAR-003 RD) |
| Bob     | High Complexity | JNT-004 (misses JNT-002; transcript is a hip case) |
| Maria   | Deferred | JNT-001 (HbA1c 7.4 is below the JNT-003 trigger) |

With `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set, Claude reads set 2 correctly (equates "endoscopy" with EGD, "saw a nutritionist once" with no RD, "two gym sessions" with no formal PT) and fires the fuller finding set — **so demo quality depends on the Anthropic key being configured on Vercel.** To make the local fallback match, the guardrails in `lib/analyze-local.js` / `server.ps1` must be broadened to the new wording (touches the load-bearing heuristic AND set 1's smoke tests — scope carefully).

Claude mode may produce extra defensible findings; the set-1 dispositions must still hold.

```

`lib/analyze-local.js` is a faithful JS port of `Invoke-LocalAnalysis`, including the regex guardrails per SOP id. Keep both in sync.

### Analyze response shape
The shared JSON contract returned by `/api/analyze` (consumed by `renderResults` in `app.html`):
```
{
  ok, engine, model, crm_record,
  patient_summary, recommendation,
  findings[],
  overall_disposition,
  next_steps[],
  extraction,        // populated when ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set; null + extraction_error otherwise
  elapsed_ms,
  claude_error?     // present when Claude analysis fell back to local heuristic
}
```
Both engines must produce this shape. Changing it requires touching `lib/analyze-local.js`, `lib/analyze-claude.js`, `server.ps1`, AND `renderResults`.

- `patient_summary` and `recommendation` must be **grounded in the transcript only** — the LLM is passed `case_type` for routing/`applies_to` gating but is explicitly forbidden from referencing EHR/CRM data, demographics, or any fact not stated in the call. The local heuristic's summary builder also avoids CRM-derived demographics.
- `findings[].evidence` is rendered inline as the "Patient quote:" snippet next to the matching `[SOP-ID]` step in Next Steps, NOT in the Findings card.
- `next_steps[]` is a flat string array (`[SOP-ID] action` plus a disposition tail step and a documentation step). Note: the unified case-document schema in `schemas/extraction-schema.json` defines a richer **structured** next_steps array; that's the extractor's output, not the analyze pipeline's.

### Four LLM endpoints
- **Anthropic Claude** drives `/api/preflight` (upload gate), `/api/analyze` (analysis), `/api/extract` (clinical flags), and `/api/draft-email` (patient email). Analysis + extraction run in parallel via `Promise.allSettled` inside `/api/analyze`. Extraction failure is tolerated: the analyze response still succeeds with `extraction: null` + `extraction_error`.
- **Google Gemini** drives `/api/evaluate`. The frontend fires it automatically after `renderResults` and passes `r.extraction` alongside the analysis output.

**The extraction object is no longer rendered in the UI** — it survives only as Gemini-evaluator input. There is no Clinical Extraction card. If you re-introduce per-flag UI later, see git history around commit `a9136a2` for the previous render code.

## SOP schema (sops.json, v2.0)

`sops.json` top-level keys: `version`, `last_updated`, `rules[]`, `status_priority`, `status_colors`. The analyzer reads `rules[]` (NOT `sops[]`) — older v1 code that referenced `(Get-Sops).sops` will silently produce no findings.

Each rule:
```
{ id, category, applies_to: ["joint","bariatric"], finding, case_status, action,
  required_flags: [...], trigger_logic: "..." }
```

- `applies_to` is lowercase and gates the rule against `crm_record.case_type` (case-insensitive). Rules outside the patient's case type are skipped by the local engine, and the Claude prompt is told to do the same.
- `case_status` is the disposition contributed when the rule fires. The frontend mirrors `status_colors`/`status_priority` in its CSS classes — keep them in sync if you add statuses.
- `required_flags` and `trigger_logic` are documentation/intent fields. The local engine doesn't evaluate `trigger_logic` directly; each SOP id has a hand-written guardrail block in `evaluateRule` (`lib/analyze-local.js`) that implements the same intent. Claude sees these fields verbatim in the prompt.

## Extraction schema (schemas/extraction-schema.json)

The unified **case-document** contract for `/api/extract`. Top-level: `version`, `case_id`, `patient`, `clinical_flags`, `sop_recommendations[]`, `next_steps[]` (structured objects with `step_id`, `description`, `triggered_by_sop`, `priority`, `status`, `confidence`, `assigned_to`, `due_date`), `case_summary`, `overall_case_status`, `extraction_metadata`, `evaluation`. Leaf values in the file are pseudo-type strings (e.g. `"boolean | null"`) that the extractor replaces with concrete values. The `evaluation` block is left as a null placeholder — the dedicated `/api/evaluate` (Gemini) fills it downstream.

**Intentionally dropped from earlier schema revisions** (do not re-add unless requested):
- `additional_context` (comorbidities, blood-clot history, oxygen dependence, current medications, mobility status).
- `extraction_metadata.speaker_labels_present`, `inaudible_count`, `contradictions[]` (Layer 3 transcript-quality fields). The extractor prompt and the UI no longer reference them.

## EHR schema (schemas/ehr-schema.json)

Contract for the patient-panel display: `name`, `age`, `sex`, `location`, `employer`, `bmi`, `height_in`, `weight_lb`, `phone`. The backing data in `crm.json` contains more (`case_type`, `primary_dx`, `patient_id`, `name_aliases`, `email`) but those are not rendered in the EHR card — `case_type` is used server-side for SOP gating, `name_aliases` for the CRM-transcript match guard, but neither is exposed to the LLM in `patient_summary`/`recommendation` (see "Claude prompt / response handling" below).

## Key behaviors / gotchas

### Disposition priority (most blocking first)
`Pending - Callback Required (0) > Ineligible (1) > Deferred (2) > High Complexity (3) > Review (4) > Revision Case (5) > Hold (6) > Action Required (7)`. `Cleared` and `Pending - Callback Required` are **internal-only** sentinels — neither is in `sops.json#status_priority` and neither is selectable in the SOP editor. `Pending - Callback Required` is set by the post-process in `pages/api/analyze.js` when the extractor reports incompleteness (`null_flag_count >= 3` OR `requires_human_review === true`); see "Incomplete-transcript post-process" below. Four places must stay in sync:
1. `STATUS_PRIORITY` in `lib/disposition.js`.
2. `$STATUS_PRIORITY` in `server.ps1`.
3. The numbered list in the Claude analysis system prompt (`lib/analyze-claude.js` and `server.ps1`).
4. The status palette + SOP editor `<select>` options in `app.html`.

### Local heuristic principles
Each SOP has a hand-written guardrail block in `evaluateRule` / `Invoke-LocalAnalysis` (`switch ($sop.id)`) gated by `applies_to`. Two recurring traps when adjusting:
1. **Don't match on the specialist's question.** Sarah's transcript contains "Have you had an EGD?" — naive keyword match for "EGD" reads as confirmation. Require negation or explicit patient-side affirmation.
2. **Don't fire on absence alone.** Maria's transcript never mentions PT — JNT-002 must not fire just because PT wasn't discussed. Fire only when the topic is raised AND a weak/no-attempt response is present.

After ANY change to the heuristic, re-run all 3 sample transcripts and confirm the table above still holds.

### Claude prompt / response handling
The system prompt in `lib/analyze-claude.js` (mirrored in `server.ps1`) is load-bearing in ten ways. **All Anthropic calls (analyze, extract) run at `temperature: 0`** for determinism — same transcript must produce the same output. Don't reintroduce default temperature; the smoke tests depend on this.

1. **No CRM/EHR grounding + no invented clinical facts.** A top-of-prompt rule forbids any reference to CRM/EHR data, demographics, or facts not in the transcript. Two sub-prohibitions: (a) never invent name/age/sex/location/BMI/primary_dx unless explicitly stated; (b) never invent clinical history (DVT, comorbidities, prior procedures, allergies, lab values, risk factors not mentioned). The universal closing rule: *every concrete clinical detail in your output must be traceable to a specific sentence in the transcript*. Past failure mode: the analyzer kept hallucinating a "historical DVT" mention that wasn't in Bob's transcript.
2. **Patient Certainty Rule** — a finding fires ONLY on direct, confirmed evidence. Hedges ("maybe", "I think", "I'm not sure", "I don't know", "I can't remember", "I did some stuff", "a while back") are explicitly non-triggering. Empty findings array is the CORRECT output for ambiguous calls. Daniel-style hedge calls now produce zero findings → post-process routes them to Pending.
3. **Direct denial dominates nearby softening** — when one response contains both a direct denial AND softening words about adjacent activities ("Honestly no... I tried the gym a couple of times but never did real PT"), the direct denial governs. The patient is confirming `attempted_pt == false` and JNT-002 fires. Distinguish from pure hedges (no direct yes/no anywhere) which still don't fire.
4. **SOP-specific clinical intent** — read flag values against the rule's PURPOSE, not just the patient's literal words. JNT-002 fires when the patient has not completed a *formal supervised PT trial*: informal exercise / a few gym sessions / self-directed activity → `attempted_pt = false` for SOP purposes (the rule's action says "Refer to 6-12 week conservative PT trial" — informal activity doesn't satisfy that bar). Symmetric clarifications cover JNT-001 (a single recent slip ≠ active smoker if quit otherwise sustained) and BAR-003 (a nutritionist or pamphlet ≠ Registered Dietitian).
5. **`applies_to` gating** — the prompt instructs Claude to skip rules whose `applies_to` doesn't include the patient's case_type.
6. **Strict priority enforcement** — disposition priority is given as a numbered list with explicit instructions: "take the status of EVERY finding, look up its number, pick the LOWEST, copy verbatim." Without this, Claude picked the *last-mentioned* status instead of the most-blocking one.
7. **Consistency rule (findings ↔ recommendation ↔ disposition)** — every SOP id in `recommendation` or `patient_summary` MUST appear in `findings[]`, and vice versa. `overall_disposition.status` is computed from `findings` alone via the priority rule, never from rules described only in prose. Without this, the analyzer described "two SOPs fire" while the structured findings only listed one.
8. **`next_steps` requires one entry per finding** — for EVERY entry in findings, produce one step prefixed with its SOP id in brackets. A finding without a corresponding `[SOP-ID]` step is a routing error. Two findings produce two SOP-prefixed steps even when one drives the disposition. The disposition tail step and documentation step come AFTER all SOP-prefixed steps.
9. **`next_steps` ordering** — Claude must write `next_steps` *last*, deriving each step from the already-written `patient_summary` / `recommendation`, sequenced in priority order, with the documentation step pinned to the end.
10. **Robust JSON extraction** — the response parser locates the outermost `{...}` and parses that, instead of just stripping code fences. Claude sometimes wraps JSON in prose; the simpler approach broke with `Invalid JSON primitive: ..`. Don't simplify back to fence-stripping.

### Incomplete-transcript post-process (Next.js only)
`pages/api/analyze.js` runs `applyIncompleteTranscriptRule` after both engines resolve. The current design treats the analyzer's findings as **authoritative** — they come from direct transcript evidence with quotes. The extractor's flag state is informational, not subtractive. Behavior:

1. **Analyzer findings pass through unchanged.** Even if the extractor was bashful and left a rule's `required_flags` as null, an analyzer finding for that same rule (e.g., "I had a sleeve in 2018" → BAR-001) stays. The Patient Certainty Rule in the analyze prompt is the safeguard against the analyzer producing hedged findings in the first place.
2. **`unresolvable[]` is informational.** A rule lands there only when **both** paths agree there's no signal: the analyzer did NOT fire it, AND at least one of its `required_flags` is null in the extraction. Each entry: `{ id, finding, missing_flags }`. Rendered as the "Unresolvable Rules" card after Findings.
3. **Pending - Callback Required override** fires only when `findings.length === 0` AND extraction is incomplete (`null_flag_count >= 3` OR `requires_human_review === true`). In that case `overall_disposition` becomes `{ status: "Pending - Callback Required", reason: "Insufficient data to evaluate SOPs; follow-up needed." }` and `next_steps` is replaced with a dynamic follow-up questionnaire built from `FLAG_TO_TOPIC` plus the documentation step. If the analyzer fired even one finding, that finding's status drives the disposition instead.

**History worth knowing** — this was first implemented as "strip any analyzer finding whose rule has a null required_flag, then override." That caused **under-firing**: even Sarah's solid `"I had a sleeve in 2018"` was thrown away because the extractor hadn't populated `prior_weight_loss_surgery`. The reverse failure mode (Daniel's `"Maybe?"` hedges producing four findings of Ineligible) was fixed by the Patient Certainty Rule in the analyze prompt, not by the post-process. Keep both safeguards together — softening either one regresses one of the two cases.

Local-heuristic-only mode skips the post-process (no extraction object). PowerShell mode lacks `/api/extract` so the pipeline change does not apply there.

### Defensive error envelope (`/api/analyze`)
The whole handler is wrapped in a try/catch that converts any unhandled exception to a JSON 500 (`{ ok: false, error, where: "analyze handler" }`) instead of letting Vercel render its HTML error page (which would surface in the browser as the unhelpful `Unexpected token '<', <!DOCTYPE ... is not valid JSON`). A second try/catch wraps `applyIncompleteTranscriptRule` and falls back to the raw analyzer result on post-process failure. Both error paths log to the Vercel function log with `ANALYZE FATAL:` and `applyIncompleteTranscriptRule threw:` prefixes for quick diagnosis.

### Gemini evaluator (4-dimension QA scoring)
`/api/evaluate` returns `{ ok, evaluator, model, evaluation }` where `evaluation` carries four named dimensions (0.0–1.0 floats):
- **`sop_accuracy`** (40% weight) — **DETERMINISTIC, server-side.** Computed by `lib/score-sop-accuracy.js`, NOT Gemini.
- **`extraction_completeness`** (30%) — **DETERMINISTIC, server-side.** Computed by `lib/score-extraction-completeness.js`, NOT Gemini.
- **`next_step_actionability`** (20%) — **DETERMINISTIC, server-side.** Computed by `lib/score-next-step-actionability.js`, NOT Gemini.
- **`human_review_appropriateness`** (10%) — **DETERMINISTIC, server-side.** Computed by `lib/score-human-review.js`, NOT Gemini.

`evaluator` field is `"gemini+deterministic"` normally, or `"deterministic"` when the Gemini call failed (see next paragraph). **All four dimensions are overridden server-side** in `pages/api/evaluate.js`. Gemini is still called, but every dimension's value is replaced before the response is sent. `overall_score` is recomputed using the 40/30/20/10 weights after the overrides; `score_label` and `needs_escalation` are also refreshed.

**Gemini failure is non-fatal (`pages/api/evaluate.js`).** Because all four scores are deterministic and Gemini's numeric output is discarded, a transient Gemini error (503 overloaded, 429, timeout) must NOT fail the whole evaluation — otherwise the UI shows "Unavailable" confidence pills for scores that don't even depend on Gemini. The `invokeGeminiEvaluation` call is wrapped in try/catch: on failure it falls through to the deterministic scorers with an empty seed `evaluation`, returns HTTP 200 with `evaluator: "deterministic"` and an `evaluator_notes` explaining Gemini was unavailable. Scores are identical whether Gemini is up or down. Do NOT revert this to a bare `await invokeGeminiEvaluation(...)` — that reintroduces the "Unavailable" bug. (The PowerShell `/api/evaluate` has no deterministic fallback — its scores come from Gemini — so it still hard-fails on Gemini errors; that path is deprecated.)

**Why deterministic for `sop_accuracy`:** through multiple prompt iterations Gemini kept scoring this dimension below 1.0 with reason text that *explicitly praised* the analyzer's output — exactly the praise-then-deduct violation the prompt forbade. Gemini's numeric output doesn't bind to prompt rules reliably enough for a clinical routing score. The deterministic scorer encodes the three named penalty grounds from the prompt and runs every time:
1. **Case_status mismatch:** any finding whose `status` doesn't match its SOP's `case_status` in `sops.json` → -0.3 each.
2. **Disposition mismatch:** `overall_disposition.status` must equal the case_status of the lowest-priority-number finding → -0.3 if violated.
3. **Null-flag firing:** a finding whose corresponding SOP's `required_flags` include a null value in the extraction → -0.4 each.

Floor at 0, ceiling at 1. The fourth ground from the prompt ("rule missing despite explicit transcript evidence") is fuzzy and left to the analyzer's Patient Certainty Rule; the deterministic check doesn't try to second-guess that.

**Why deterministic for `extraction_completeness`:** same praise-then-deduct failure mode. Gemini repeatedly penalized null flags using `extraction_metadata.null_flag_count` as the signal — but short transcripts that only cover a few topics legitimately produce many nulls (e.g. Bob's PT+opioids call never mentions dental or smoking, so those flags are correctly null). The deterministic scorer encodes the actual rule: a null is only a penalty when the transcript contains evidence the topic WAS raised.

For each flag applicable to the patient's `case_type` (general flags always apply; joint/bariatric flags gated by `case_type` from extraction or CRM), the scorer:
1. Reads the flag value from `extraction.clinical_flags`.
2. If non-null, no penalty — skip.
3. If null, tests the transcript against a per-flag keyword regex (e.g. `active_smoker` → `/smoke|smoker|smoking|cigarette|tobacco|vape|nicotine/i`).
4. If the keyword matches, the null is unjustified → -0.2.

Score: 1.0 baseline; floor 0, ceiling 1. Keyword map and applicability lists live at the top of `lib/score-extraction-completeness.js` — keep in sync with `schemas/extraction-schema.json` if you add flags.

**Recognizable reason text** — both deterministic scorers produce reason text that's distinct from Gemini prose:
- `sop_accuracy`: either lists specific violations *with the SOP id and field name* or reads `"All fired rules carry correct case_status, ... Deterministic check."`
- `extraction_completeness`: either lists unjustified-null flag names by extraction key or reads `"Every applicable flag is either populated or its topic was never raised in the transcript. Deterministic check."`

If you see this text, the override fired. If you see Gemini-style prose with a sub-1.0 score on either dimension, the deployment is stale.

The frontend uses `sop_accuracy.score` for the Recommendation header pill and `next_step_actionability.score` for the Next Steps header pill (scaled ×100; color bands red 0-50 / yellow 51-75 / green 76-100). The full breakdown renders in the Evaluation card — positioned **immediately after the Next Steps card** (which ends with the draft patient email), and before the Triggered SOP Findings card. A red **Escalation recommended** banner appears when `needs_escalation` is true.

**Cost note:** the evaluator user message embeds the entire extraction JSON plus the analyze output, so it's significantly larger than the original 2-pill prompt. If you hit 429s on Gemini, the Flash-Lite quota is the most common cause.

**Gemini model trap:** `gemini-2.0-flash` has a free-tier limit of 0 on at least some accounts. Both engines now **default** to `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` in code (`lib/evaluate-gemini.js` and `server.ps1`), overridable via `GEMINI_MODEL` in `.env` / Vercel env — do not reintroduce `gemini-2.0-flash` as a default. Legacy `gemini-1.5-*` names are no longer served on `v1beta` for new keys. To enumerate what's available for a key: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models?key=...`. Frontend silently degrades to "Confidence unavailable" pills on Gemini failure — check browser console for the underlying error.

### Edge-case handling (Layer 1, 2, 4)
**Layer 1 — Upload (`onFileChosen`):**
- Unsupported extension → `alert()` listing supported types, block.
- Empty file → `alert()` after read, block.
- Encoding / parse errors → `try/catch`; alert suggests re-export as UTF-8.

**Layer 2 — Pre-flight gate (`/api/preflight`):** small Claude call (input capped at 4000 chars) returning `{ is_clinical_transcript, detected_language, reason }`. Frontend gates `/api/analyze` on the result:
- `is_clinical_transcript === false` → alert "This document does not appear to be a patient care transcript…", block.
- `detected_language !== "english"` → alert "English only is supported at this time", block.

Returns 503 when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is missing; the frontend treats 503 as skip-gate so local-heuristic-only mode still works.

**Layer 4 — Timeouts + JSON safety:** every LLM fetch wraps an `AbortController` with a per-route timeout (preflight 15s, analyze 50s, extract 50s, evaluate 25s). `vercel.json` declares `maxDuration` per route (preflight 20s, analyze/extract 60s, evaluate 30s) so Vercel doesn't kill the function before the timeout fires. `lib/extract.js` uses `max_tokens: 4000` and wraps `JSON.parse` with a safe schema-shaped fallback (empty flags, `requires_human_review: true`, `review_reason` explains the truncation, `__parse_error` retained for debugging). Client-side `onAnalyze` has a 90s `AbortController` safety net and surfaces "Analysis is taking longer than expected. Please try again." on timeout (with the transcript hash logged for pattern analysis). Pre-flight confirm() prompt when estimated input >150k tokens.

**Frontend warnings (non-blocking):** word count >15k → confirm; char count <200 → toast warning; duplicate hash (SHA-256 of the transcript stored in `SESSION_TRANSCRIPT_HASHES`) → confirm before re-analyze.

### CRM-transcript match guard
`onAnalyze` enforces that if an EHR record is loaded (`CURRENT_CRM != null`), the transcript must mention at least one of `CURRENT_CRM.name_aliases` (or the full `name`). On mismatch it shows a blocking `alert()` and calls `onLookupReset()` to clear name, ID, transcript, and prior results. If lookup was skipped (no CRM loaded), the analyzer runs against the transcript alone — `findCrmFromTranscript` may still backfill a record by alias scan server-side.

### HITL Agree/Disagree gate on Recommendation
After analysis renders, the Recommendation pane shows **Agree** / **Disagree** CTAs. Each click opens `customConfirm(...)` — an in-page modal (`#confirmModal`) that replaces the browser-native `confirm()` so the popup doesn't show the `<vercel-domain> says` title that browsers force on `confirm()`/`alert()`. The helper is `async customConfirm(message, { title, okLabel, cancelLabel })` returning `Promise<boolean>`. Other confirms in the app (duplicate-hash check, long-transcript warning, delete-SOP) still use the native `confirm()` intentionally — swap them via `customConfirm` if you need consistent styling.
- **Agree** (confirmed) → green badge + the **Next Steps card is revealed** (hidden by default via `#nextStepsWrapper`).
- **Disagree** (confirmed) → opens `#disagreeModal`, a notes modal with a free-form textarea and two CTAs:
  - **Cancel** → closes the modal and resets the recoDecision UI so the Specialist can choose again. The decision is never committed.
  - **Push Notes to Patient Profile** → posts to `/api/integrations/export` with `kind: disagree_notes`, locks the recoDecision with "Notes pushed to the patient profile. Please return to the EHR system to review the case.", and shows the orange `#disagreeCard` banner. Empty notes are rejected with a toast.

The Evaluation and Triggered SOP Findings cards render regardless of the Agree/Disagree decision (they're audit/QA info, not action surfaces).

### Per-step thumbs gating + Copy Message (Next Steps card)
Each step row in `renderSteps` carries state in `STEP_STATE[i] = { vote, done, notes_pushed }`. A row is `locked` when `done || notes_pushed`:
- The recommended EHR CTA is `disabled` until 👍 (then `vote === "up"` enables it). Clicking 👍 again toggles back to undecided.
- 👎 **opens `#stepDownModal`**, a notes modal scoped to that step. It shows the step text (read-only), a free-form notes textarea, and two CTAs:
  - **Cancel** → closes the modal; the 👎 vote is never committed (row returns to undecided).
  - **Push to Patient Profile** → posts to `/api/integrations/export` with `kind: step_disagree_notes` and `step_index` / `step_text` / `notes`. On success: commits `vote = "down"` + `notes_pushed = true`, removes this step from `COPIED_STEP_MESSAGES` (so it's excluded from Draft Email), and locks the row with a red **"Notes pushed"** badge.
- After a successful `/api/integrations/export` on the EHR CTA, the row is marked `done` and locked with a green **"Completed"** badge.
- The CTA target/kind is inferred from the step text by `inferStepCta` (keyword match on "document", "notify", "schedule", "escalate", "request", "revision pathway", "close case"). All CTAs target "EHR" labels. If you add new disposition-tail wording, update `inferStepCta`.

**Copy Message button** appears alongside the EHR CTA on **patient-communication steps** — `PATIENT_COMM_SOPS = {GEN-001, JNT-001, JNT-002, BAR-002, BAR-003}` plus a keyword fallback (`notify|refer|instruct|cessation|...`). Internal-only SOPs (`JNT-003`, `JNT-004`, `BAR-001`) and the documentation tail step do NOT get the button. Clicking it copies a per-step patient-facing message (templates in `PATIENT_MESSAGES_BY_SOP`) to the clipboard via `navigator.clipboard.writeText` AND pushes onto `COPIED_STEP_MESSAGES` (deduped by `stepIndex`) for the Draft Email aggregator. **Copy Message stays enabled on `done` rows** — only `notes_pushed` rows disable it — so the Specialist can: approve → Update EHR → Copy Message → next step.

### Draft patient email (Claude-drafted, bottom of Next Steps)
The auto-generated email template was replaced with a Claude-drafted flow:
1. As the Specialist clicks Copy Message on comm steps, entries accumulate in `COPIED_STEP_MESSAGES` (`{stepIndex, sopId, stepText, message}`). The "Draft Email (N steps)" CTA at the bottom of the Next Steps card stays disabled until at least one message has been copied. The count updates live via `renderDraftEmailControls`.
2. Clicking **Draft Email** posts to `POST /api/draft-email` ([lib/draft-email.js](lib/draft-email.js)) with `{ patient_name, case_type, disposition, copied_messages[], specialist_name }`. Claude returns STRICT JSON `{ subject, body }`. 30s `AbortController` timeout; `max_tokens: 1000`. Vercel `maxDuration: 35`.
3. The frontend assembles `Subject: ...\n\n<body>` into an editable textarea + a **Copy Email** button. The Specialist can edit before copying.

**Prompt rule worth knowing** (commit `26defb9`): every entry in `copied_messages` must render as its own bullet line — Claude is forbidden from merging two messages into one bullet, paraphrasing a message into the disposition intro paragraph, or dropping a bullet because its content overlaps the disposition framing. The disposition intro is general-purpose framing only and cannot borrow content from the copied messages. The only allowed dedup is two messages referencing the exact same SOP id with identical text. Past failure: Bob's "notify patient of ineligibility" message was being absorbed into the intro paragraph, leaving only the PT bullet visible.

`COPIED_STEP_MESSAGES` resets in `renderResults` for each new analysis, so the email always reflects the *current* case. `onCopyEmail` reads the textarea (not the original draft) so edits survive the copy.

Both copy actions use `navigator.clipboard.writeText`, which requires HTTPS or `localhost` (works on Vercel and `npm run dev`). The whole Next Steps card — including the Draft Email block — is gated by the recommendation Agree/Disagree decision and only appears after the Specialist clicks Agree.

### Mock SSO / Integrations
- **SSO gate removed.** The app boots directly via `initApp()` (bottom of `app.html`'s script), which hardcodes the `Jordan G / Care Specialist` identity and calls `refreshSops()`. `/api/sso/signin` still returns the same user but is now dead code — nothing in the UI calls it.
- `/api/integrations/import` is a stub that returns canned transcripts per source (`googleworkspace` / `five9` / default). **Currently not called from the UI** — all three import buttons (Upload File / Import from Google Workspace / Import from Five9) trigger `#fileInput.click()` so the Specialist always picks a `.txt` from their local file system. The branded buttons exist for demo polish and visually carry inline-SVG emblems via `.brand-icon`. The endpoint and the `onImportSample` JS helper are dead-code paths kept for future re-wiring; safe to delete if you don't need them.
- `/api/integrations/export` returns a fake `EXP-######` reference. Called from multiple places with different `kind` values: per-step EHR CTAs (no `kind`, just `step_index`/`step_text`), step thumbs-down (`kind: step_disagree_notes`), recommendation Disagree (`kind: disagree_notes`). All carry the original `LAST_RESULT` as payload.
- **Don't let "make these real" silently turn into real integrations.** They are deliberately stubs — anything wiring them to real Salesforce/Google Workspace/Five9/Outlook must be explicitly scoped.

### File upload (frontend, browser-side)
The transcript textarea accepts `.txt .md .log .html .htm .json .csv .xml .srt .vtt .docx .pdf`. `onFileChosen` dispatches by extension:
- Plain text formats read with `FileReader.readAsText`.
- `.html`/`.htm` are stripped to text via a temporary DOM node.
- `.srt`/`.vtt` have cue numbers and `HH:MM:SS,mmm --> ...` timestamps stripped before being placed in the textarea.
- `.json` is run through `flattenJsonTranscript` — looks for an array under `messages|transcript|dialogue|conversation|turns|utterances|entries`, maps each entry's `speaker|role|from|author|name` and `text|content|utterance|message|body`, and emits `Speaker [timestamp]: text` lines. Falls back to raw JSON if no recognizable structure is found.
- `.docx` uses `mammoth.browser.min.js` (CDN, lazy-loaded on first use).
- `.pdf` uses `pdfjs-dist` (CDN, lazy-loaded on first use, with a worker URL fallback).

CDN libraries are loaded once via `loadScriptOnce` and cached on `window.__scripts`. They are the only external runtime dependencies — keep this contained to the upload path.

### PowerShell 5.1 traps (these have all bitten in prior versions)
1. **Source must be ASCII-only.** PS 5.1 reads UTF-8-without-BOM as Windows-1252 — em-dashes, smart quotes, etc., cause cryptic parse errors.
2. **`Set-Content -Encoding utf8` writes UTF-8-WITH-BOM in PS 5.1.** Doing this to `sops.json` or `crm.json` prepends a `U+FEFF` byte that crashes `JSON.parse` on Vercel with the misleading `Unexpected token '﻿', "﻿{ ... is not valid JSON`. Defenses in place: `readSops` / `readCrm` in `lib/data.js` strip a leading BOM before parsing. To write JSON from PS without BOM: `[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText($path, $text, (New-Object System.Text.UTF8Encoding $false))`. Or use the Edit/Write tools (no BOM). Or PS 7's `-Encoding utf8NoBOM`.
3. **`$resp.OutputStream.Close()` in every code path** (success AND error). HttpListener leaks otherwise.
4. **No ternary.** Use `if (cond) { val } else { other }`.
5. **`ConvertFrom-Json` returns PSCustomObject**, not hashtable — use `.foo` not `["foo"]`.

### UTF-8 round-trip on the Anthropic path
Three explicit UTF-8 boundaries in `server.ps1` (any one of them defaulting back to ANSI mangles non-ASCII transcripts):
1. **Read request body** — `StreamReader($req.InputStream, [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8)` in `Read-RequestBody`.
2. **Send to Anthropic** — `[System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($bodyJson)`, pass byte array as `-Body`.
3. **Decode response** — `Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing` + `[System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString($rawResp.RawContentStream.ToArray())`. **Do not** use `Invoke-RestMethod` — it auto-decodes via the response's declared charset and falls back to Latin-1.

The Anthropic catch block reads `$_.Exception.Response.GetResponseStream()` to surface the real error body. Don't strip it out.

## SOP Library — read-only in the UI

The **SOP Library tab is view-only** (commit `33309e6`). The Add SOP button, per-card Edit/Delete buttons, the SOP edit modal, and the `openSopEditor` / `onSaveSop` / `onDeleteSop` JS were all removed. The grid still renders each rule's id, status badge, finding, category + applies_to, action, and trigger_logic — but no mutation surface.

The CRUD route handlers (`POST /api/sops`, `PUT /api/sops/{id}`, `DELETE /api/sops/{id}`) still exist in `pages/api/sops/*` and still call `writeSops` (`lib/data.js`) which throws `READONLY` when `process.env.VERCEL` is set. Nothing in the UI currently invokes them. Re-introducing SOP editing would mean re-adding the UI; the server side is dormant but intact.

To change SOP content, edit `sops.json` in the repo and push — `main` auto-deploys.

## Files

| File / dir | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `next.config.js`, `vercel.json` | Next.js + Vercel configuration. package name is `clinical-transcript-navigator`. `/` rewrites to `/app.html`. `vercel.json` declares per-route `maxDuration` (analyze/extract 60s, draft-email 35s, evaluate 30s, preflight 20s). `package-lock.json` is committed for reproducible installs. |
| `pages/api/*.js` | Serverless route handlers — health, sso/signin, crm/lookup, sops (GET/POST), sops/[id] (PUT/DELETE), integrations/import, integrations/export, analyze, extract, evaluate, preflight, draft-email. Pages router (not App router) for simpler `req.body` handling. |
| `lib/data.js` | Reads `sops.json`/`crm.json`. `writeSops` throws `READONLY` when `process.env.VERCEL` is set. CRM lookup helpers (by query and from-transcript). |
| `lib/disposition.js` | `STATUS_PRIORITY` map and `getOverallDisposition`. Mirrored in `server.ps1` and the Claude prompts — keep all in sync. |
| `lib/analyze-local.js` | Faithful JS port of `Invoke-LocalAnalysis`, including per-SOP regex guardrails and the no-CRM-data summary builder. |
| `lib/analyze-claude.js` | Anthropic API call with the strict-no-CRM + priority + JSON-extraction prompt. 50s timeout. |
| `lib/extract.js` | Anthropic API call for structured flag extraction; reads `schemas/extraction-schema.json` at request time so schema edits go live without a redeploy. 50s timeout, `max_tokens: 4000`, safe-fallback on parse failure. |
| `lib/preflight.js` | Anthropic API call for the upload gate — returns `is_clinical_transcript` + `detected_language`. Input capped at 4000 chars; 15s timeout. |
| `lib/draft-email.js` | Anthropic API call that drafts the patient email from `COPIED_STEP_MESSAGES`. Returns STRICT JSON `{ subject, body }`. 30s timeout, `max_tokens: 1000`. |
| `lib/evaluate-gemini.js` | Gemini API call for the four evaluator dimensions. Default model `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` (free-tier-0 traps on `gemini-2.0-flash` for new keys). 25s timeout. **`sop_accuracy` AND `extraction_completeness` are deterministic and override Gemini's values in `pages/api/evaluate.js`** — only `next_step_actionability` and `human_review_appropriateness` reach the response as Gemini-judged. |
| `lib/score-extraction-completeness.js` | Deterministic `extraction_completeness` scorer. Per-flag keyword regex; -0.2 for each null flag whose topic keyword appears in the transcript. Topics never raised in the transcript → null is correct → no penalty. Gated by `case_type` so joint cases aren't checked against bariatric flags and vice versa. Replaces Gemini's judgment for this dimension. |
| `lib/score-human-review.js` | Deterministic `human_review_appropriateness` scorer. **One-sided** — conservative escalation (`requires_human_review: true`) is always acceptable; the only real failure mode is suppression on incomplete data. Score 1.0 when flag is true with non-empty review_reason OR flag is false with sufficient data (null_flag_count < 3 AND findings non-empty); 0.5 when flag is true but review_reason is empty; 0.0 only when flag is false BUT review is mandatory. Replaces Gemini's judgment for this dimension. |
| `lib/score-next-step-actionability.js` | Deterministic `next_step_actionability` scorer. Validates the structural contract from the analyze prompt: one `[SOP-ID]`-prefixed step per finding (-0.3 each missing), final step matches the documentation pattern (-0.2 if not), and step count is at least `findings + 2` to include the disposition tail (-0.1 if short). Replaces Gemini's judgment for this dimension. |
| `lib/score-sop-accuracy.js` | Deterministic `sop_accuracy` scorer. Encodes the three concrete penalty grounds: case_status mismatch (-0.3 each), disposition mismatch (-0.3), null-flag firing (-0.4 each). Clean output scores 1.0. Replaces Gemini's judgment for this dimension. |
| `public/app.html` | Single-page UI. CDN libraries (mammoth, pdf.js) lazy-loaded only for `.docx`/`.pdf` upload. Hosts all client-side edge-case handling, Agree/Disagree gate, per-step Copy Message, draft email. Analyzer view uses `container.full` (no side panel — the Engine Status side card was removed). |
| `server.ps1` | PowerShell `HttpListener` backend — Windows local-only, parity with Next.js except missing `/api/preflight` and `/api/extract`. |
| `sops.json` | v2.0 SOP library under `rules[]` (8 rules: 1 General, 4 Joint, 3 Bariatric). Editable from the UI in dev only. |
| `crm.json` | Mock EHR (3 sample patients). Edit `name_aliases` to control which transcripts match. |
| `schemas/extraction-schema.json` | Unified case-document contract for `/api/extract`. Leaf values are pseudo-type strings (`"boolean | null"`) replaced by the extractor with concrete values. The `evaluation` block is a null placeholder filled by `/api/evaluate`. |
| `schemas/ehr-schema.json` | EHR patient-panel display contract (name, age, sex, location, employer, BMI, height/weight, phone). |
| `samples/` | Standalone sample transcripts for manual upload testing. |
| `.env.example` | Template — copy to `.env` and add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, optional `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` / `GEMINI_MODEL`. |
| `.gitignore` | `.env`, `.env.*` (with `!.env.example`), `node_modules/`, `.next/`, `.vercel/`. **Load-bearing for security.** |
| `.gitattributes` | LF in repo, CRLF for `*.ps1` working trees, binary markers for png/pdf/docx etc. |
| `.claude/launch.json` | Preview configs: `premier-analyzer` (PowerShell `server.ps1`) and `premier-next` (`npm run dev`, the full-feature Next.js path). |

### Git / repository

`main` is deployed to Vercel automatically. `.gitignore` is load-bearing for keeping the Anthropic and Gemini keys out of the repo — run `git check-ignore -v .env` before any commit that touches gitignore. **Never `git add -f .env` and never copy `.env` to a name other than `.env.example`** — `.env.txt` was the bug we hit pre-push that almost shipped a real key.
